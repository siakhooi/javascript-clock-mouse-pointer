This script was not created by me.
It was created by a brilliant programmer, many years ago, probably around year 2000-2008. The script has been circulated via email forwarding during that time, again and again, I believed.
The JavaScript code was written with support IE4 and Netscape Navigator 4 syntax.

## Changes

I have refactored the scripts to remove those IE4 and Netscape Navigator syntax into javascript today.

## Disclaimer

I don't hold any copyright of this code, nor any responsibility of any consequences of using this code.
The purpose of the repo is just to share the brilliant code that I have encountered previously.
I don't know who was the programmer that wrote this, but Bravo! You are a great programmer!
